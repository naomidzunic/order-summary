## My process

I started out with the mobile first workflow and then 



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Wow, starting out with mobile first workflow is beyond easier than starting out in desktop. Today was a big milestone as I was able to complete the mobile first in just a few hours. Of course this is just basic CSS without media queries or anything but I now understand flexbox and how to use it to manipulate direction. 

I also took my time in managing each of the sections. I've found it's been very helpful adding borders to each of the sections so that I can visually see what is happening and how I can change it appropriately.
